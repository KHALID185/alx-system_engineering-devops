Postmortem: The Virtual Server Meltdown

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 10, 2024, 11:30 AM — 4:00 PM (PST)
Impact: Complete service outage. All users (100%) were affected and couldn’t access the application due to a server crash caused by a traffic spike.

Root Cause: A misconfigured auto-scaling policy failed to handle the sudden increase in traffic, leading to server overload and a crash.

Timeline:
11:30 AM: Issue detected via automated alerts indicating server downtime.
11:35 AM: DevOps began investigating; suspected network issue or DDoS attack.
12:00 PM: Focus shifted to resource depletion; initial checks misleadingly pointed to a memory leak.
1:15 PM: Escalated to the infrastructure team after initial troubleshooting failed.
2:00 PM: Identified the root cause — incorrect auto-scaling settings.
3:00 PM: Manually scaled server instances to stabilize the system.
4:00 PM: Full service was restored after testing confirmed stability.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The auto-scaling was set to trigger incorrectly, not accounting for high traffic. This caused the server to max out its resources and crash. We resolved it by correcting the scaling policy and temporarily scaling up the server instances manually.

Preventative Measures:
Review Auto-Scaling: Adjust and optimize scaling policies.
Load Testing: Regularly test the system’s ability to handle traffic spikes.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement better resource monitoring to catch issues early.
Improve Documentation: Update scaling policies and emergency procedures.
Team Training: Train engineers on scaling and monitoring best practices.
